# Titanic-Classification-Competition

This is my attempt at Kaggle's titanic prediction competition.
This a classic binary classification problem. We are required to build a model that predicts if a passenger survives the journey using some features.
We are given a training set with 891 observations, and our preformence is measured using our accuracy on a test set with 418 observations.

In the repository the Jupyter Notebook of the project, and also added it as a pdf anf py files. I uploaded the predictions I submitted as well.
